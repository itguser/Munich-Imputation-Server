<h3>HLA Imputation Pipeline</h3>

In addition to intergenic SNPs, HLA imputation outputs five different types of markers: (1) binary marker for classical HLA alleles; (2) binary marker for the presence/absence of a specific amino acid residue; (3) HLA intragenic SNPs, and (4) binary markers for insertion/deletions, as described in the typical output below. The goal is to minimize prior assumption on which types of variations will be causal and test all types of variations simultaneously in an unbiased fashion. However, the users are always free to restrict analyses to specific marker subsets.<br> <br>

<p>We note that our current implementation of the reference panel is limited to the G-group resolution (DNA sequences that determine the exons 2 and 3 for class I and exon 2 for class II genes), and amino acid positions outside the binding groove were taken as its best approximation. When converting G-group alleles to the two-field resolution, we first approximated G-group alleles to their corresponding allele at the four-field resolution based on the ordered allele list in the distributed IPD-IMGT/HLA database (version 3.32.0). We explicitly include exonic information in the HLA-TAPAS output.</p>
