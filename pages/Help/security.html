<h1>Data Security</h1>

Since data is transfered to our server located in Michigan, a wide array of security measures are in force:<br> <br>

<li>The complete interaction with the server is secured with HTTPS.</li>
<li>Input data is deleted from our servers as soon it is not needed anymore.</li>
<li>We only store the number of samples and markers analyzed, we don't ever "look" at your data in anyway</li>
<li>All results are encrypted with a strong one-time password - thus, only you can read them.</li>
<li>After imputation is finished, the data uploader has 7 days to use an encrypted connection to get results back.</li>
<li>The complete source code is available in a <a href="https://github.com/genepi/imputationserver/tree/qc-refactoring" style="text-decoration: none">public Github repository</a>.</li>

<h2>Who has access?</h2>
<p>To upload and download data, users must register with a unique e-mail address and strong password. Each user can only download imputation results for samples that they have themselves uploaded; no other imputation server users will be able to access your data.</p>

<h2>What security or firewalls protect access?</h2>
<p>A wide array of security measures are in force on the imputation servers:</p>

<li>SSH login to the servers is restricted to only systems administrators.</li>
<li>Direct root login via SSH is not allowed from the public Internet.</li>
<li>The public-facing side of the servers sits behind the School of Public Health's Checkpoint virtual firewall instance where a default-deny policy is used on inbound traffic; only explicitly allowed TCP ports are passed.</li>
<li>The School of Public Health also makes use of NIDS technologies such as Snort and Peakflow on its network links for traffic analysis and threat detection.</li>
<li>On imputation server itself, updates are run regularly by systems administrators who follow several zero-day computer security announcement lists; the OSSEC HIDS is used for log analysis and anomaly detection; and Denyhosts is used to thwart brute-force SSH login attacks.</li>

<h2>What encryption of the data is used while the data are present?</h2>
<p>Imputation results are encrypted with a one-time password generated by the system. The password consists of lower characters, upper characters, special characters and numbers with max. 3 duplicates.</p>
